# Outputs all files that have changed since master. Hence, includes:
# * Committed diffs on our branch but not on master
#   (but does not include diffs from master which are not on our branch)
# * Files that have diffs which are staged (in the index)
# * Files that have uncommitted diffs
# * Untracked files

# For example, pipe the output of this into lint to do a quick lint check
# on just the files you have messed with, rather than on all files in the repo.
