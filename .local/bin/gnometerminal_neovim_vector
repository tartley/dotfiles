#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Run Bash in a new gnome-terminal, with no scrollbar.
# In it, run nvim, asking it to adjust the terminal to 84 chars wide
# (80 + 4 for line numbers)
#
# We want nvim's PWD to be the same as the $PWD of the invoker of 'ni',
# so that relative filenames passed to nvim (using $@) are opened correctly.
#
# So we run 'cd $PWD' before invoking nvim. The $PWD is expanded
# before we pass this command-line to the new bash process.
#
# An alternative method would be gnome-terminal's --working-directory option,
# but this currently does not work for custom commands, see:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+bug/1587154

gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=vector-noscroll -- bash -c "cd $PWD; nvim -c 'set columns=84' $@"
