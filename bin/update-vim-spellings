# Convert my list of custom spelling words into Neovim's compiled format.
# This happens automatically if you mark words as correct within Neovim,
# using things like 'zg' (word spelling is good).
#
# But if we manually edit the resulting plaintext list of words (e.g. by
# sorting it, or curating the words we've previously added), then we
# need to tell nvim to do the compile step:

cd ~/.config/nvim/spell
sort -u <en.utf-8.add -o en.utf-8.add
nvim -c "mkspell! en.utf-8.add | quit"
