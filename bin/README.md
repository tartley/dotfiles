# User `bin` directories

`~/bin`
:   Files (not symlinks) that we wrote, which we'd like checking into our
    personal git dotfiles repo.

`~/.local/bin`
:   3rd party downloaded binaries, 'installed' by copying here on the PATH, or
    symlinks to same. We don't deeply care if we lose these - we can
    download them again.
